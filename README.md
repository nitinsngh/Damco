# Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using Ecliplse Community, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium 4, Maven.

## Test Subject
I've picked gamil and www.makemytrip.com as a test subject for no particular reason.
Both are a large site and does have variety of features that we can play around with.

## Libraries and Frameworks
Version for some of these can be found in the [POM](https://github.com/opantsjoha/test-automation-java/blob/master/pom.xml) file.
* Selenium - Web automation
* Maven - Build and package management
* TestNG - Test execution and Reporting

## Tools
Using [Eclipse Community](https://eclipseide.org/) version.

## Programming Language
I'm using [Java SE] version jdk1.8.0_111 and it works very well.
There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:
* It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.
* It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
* Because of the above two points it's possible to automate (testing) checking for iOS (Web and Native), Android (Web and Native) and Web platforms.
